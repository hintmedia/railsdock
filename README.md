A command line tool for Dockerizing your Rails development environment.

## Installation

_This gem depends 

Install the gem:

    $ gem install railsdock

## Usage

Navigate to your project directory:

    $ cd /path/to/my/app

Then run:

```bash
  railsdock
```

The gem will then walk you through configuring Docker by asking questions about your environment.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
